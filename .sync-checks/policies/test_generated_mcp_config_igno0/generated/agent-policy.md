<!-- BEGIN LOCAL AI HUB TOOL POLICY -->
Trigger map:
- bounded health/cache/telemetry inspection (never poll): `local_ai_status`
- repository facts/files/symbols: `local_ai_repo`
- tests/lint/typecheck/build: `local_ai_command`
- exact source/evidence text: `local_ai_artifact`
- shared findings or overlapping edits: `local_ai_coord`
- non-trivial multi-step, long-running, or acceptance-criteria work: `local_ai_coord` Agent OS task contracts, checkpoints, context, and verified completion
- semantic retrieval after indexed paths are insufficient: `local_ai_rag`
- symbol or code-relationship questions: `local_ai_repo` semantic actions (Serena symbol navigation); indexed fallback remains available
- Agent OS task and incident state: `local_ai_status(detail="agent_state")`
- curated knowledge sets and document/diagram ingestion: `local_ai_rag` docset and ingest actions
- requested automated repair, affected-test selection, formatting, or lint fixes: `local_ai_command` specialized actions
- local mock, replay, and flaky-test workflows: `local_ai_command` specialized actions
- operator-facing live dashboard: `/dashboard` on the configured Hub server; use `local_ai_status` for bounded agent-side checks

Recipes (guidance, not gates):
- Recipe — Explore: preprocess once, use the cheapest repository action, fetch only required evidence slices.
- Recipe — Change: gather indexed evidence, use `local_ai_repo(action="solve")` before edits, claim `local_ai_coord` leases for overlapping paths, then run indexed impact/review before validation.
- Recipe — Validate: route repeatable commands through `local_ai_command`, reuse cached results, use `review_diff` or `security_audit` when relevant.
- Recipe — Durable execution: create a task contract before substantial work, checkpoint phase changes, attach validation receipts, and complete only after `verify_completion` passes.
- Recipe — Retrieve: use `local_ai_rag` only after deterministic/indexed paths are exhausted.
- A recipe step may be skipped when irrelevant; one bounded fallback is allowed when Hub is unavailable.

Delegation is the default for any task with useful bounded independent work.

- Use the native Codex `multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` path only for useful independent bounded work or an explicit Codex-subagent request.
- Codex controls each subagent's scope, `allow_write`, workspace/worktree, timeout, cancellation, sandbox, and integration.
- Do not duplicate the same scope across agents. Keep final decisions, edits, and integration in Codex.
- Skip delegation only for trivial tasks, pure evidence lookups, security/privacy constraints, or no useful independent scope.

Routing hierarchy: the main agent is the orchestrator, planner, integrator and final owner. Use Local AI Hub first for its own precise, bounded microtasks: deterministic facts, indexed/search retrieval, preprocess artifacts, targeted impact/review/security checks, safe commands and targeted checks. Native `multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` is used only for useful independent bounded work or an explicit Codex-subagent request. It is not routed or managed by Local AI Hub.

READ-ONLY AUDIT CONTRACT:
- Read-only means no Git writes, `git worktree add` or removal, dependency installation, builds/imports, generated artifacts, or other workspace side effects. Never label such work read-only when any of these occur; split validation into a separately owned, explicitly side-effecting task.
- Before native discovery or validation, retain preceding Hub result with action, absolute root, status, cache/in_progress state, and evidence IDs. Native fallback requires an explicit `terminal=true` and `retryable=false` result.
- Native validation fallback is allowed only after `local_ai_command` returns `terminal=true` and `retryable=false`; run one bounded fallback, state side effects/owner, and never repeat identical commands.
- Codex controls subagent permissions per task. Native Codex subagents may write only when Codex explicitly enables it, and write work stays in the assigned workspace/worktree. Codex remains integrator.
- Do not run parallel duplicate commands or scopes. Tool labels are not evidence; preserve exact action, arguments, result, and ownership in the audit record.

For every non-trivial repository task, use Local AI Hub before broad native discovery or repeatable validation. Keep one stable absolute project root. On the first task for that root call `local_ai_repo(action="preprocess", root=ABS_ROOT)` exactly once, then continue immediately; preprocessing is asynchronous, so never poll/wait/force-refresh it.
 Then call `local_ai_repo(action="context", mode="adaptive")` as the first useful operation; it is the quality-first retrieval gate and accepts the task/context directly.

Adoption gate: `local_ai_command` alone is never sufficient for a repository task. After one-time preprocess, the first useful Hub operation must be `local_ai_repo(action="context", mode="adaptive")`; use the command broker only for commands after grounded repository evidence exists. For implementation, diagnosis, refactoring or complex review, call `local_ai_repo(action="solve")` after evidence and before native edits. After edits, use the applicable indexed impact/review/security/evidence action before final validation.

Adaptive retrieval path: call `local_ai_repo(action="context", mode="adaptive")` first; it runs bounded deterministic/indexed, structural, lexical and RAG retrieval, fuses agreement and diversity, and degrades optional backends independently. Stop escalating when evidence is sufficient; reuse cached results and bounded evidence. Do not fan out duplicate native retrieval layers or translate the task into a long grep-term list. Before native `find`/`rg`/`grep`/recursive glob/tree or opening more than two files for discovery, use that hub path first. Reuse fresh evidence IDs, artifact slices, memos and cache hits;
 do not repeat the same hub action with the same root/query while repository state is unchanged.

Treat result state as a protocol: `cache_hit`/`coalesced` means reuse the result; `in_progress=true` means another owner is doing identical work, so never duplicate it; `retryable`/429/503 means back off and do independent work; `degraded`/`stale` means verify only the affected path/slice; a non-retryable failure permits one cheaper/native fallback. Never turn a transient result into larger timeouts, force refreshes, or polling loops.

Route test/lint/typecheck/build/read-only commands through `local_ai_command` before running them natively. If it returns `in_progress=true`, do not launch a duplicate command. Before an expensive `solve`/model call, search coordination memos for reusable findings. For overlapping multi-agent edits use `local_ai_coord` leases and store concise reusable discoveries as memos.
 After edits, use indexed impact/review plus targeted cached validation; do not rerun broad discovery merely because files changed. `force` and `preprocess_refresh` are recovery/admin controls, never retry buttons. If an optional backend degrades, accept the hub's deterministic/index fallback. If the hub itself is unavailable, make one bounded health/retry attempt, then fall back to native tools. Never loop on health, status, preprocessing, model startup, a failing backend, or an identical command.

Batch repository replacement: use `local_ai_repo(action="batch_replace", edits=[...], dry_run=true)` for preview. `staged` is not batch dry-run and is never forwarded. Each edit must exact-match once. The engine preflights all edits, rolls back write failures, and performs no auto-commit. Set `dry_run=false` only after review.

Selection guide: `local_ai_repo` for bounded repository facts and checks (including `review_diff` and `security_audit`), `local_ai_command` for bounded repeatable commands, `local_ai_rag` only after cheaper indexed evidence, `local_ai_artifact` for exact slices, `local_ai_coord` for leases/memos and Agent OS task, memory, context, and verification workflows.

## Context economy contract

- Every Hub response is aggregate-bounded (default ≈6400 tokens).
- `response_budget.returned_tokens` measures the final serialized response envelope in `estimated_tokens` and stays at or below the requested budget.
- Preserve protected status, error, evidence, and context-identity fields; keep exact detail artifact-backed.
- Claim savings only with a current `baseline_evidence_id`; report signed `token_savings_delta_est`, including negative values; keep `protocol_tokens_est`, `schema_tokens_est`, and `local_compute_reused_tokens_est` separate.
- Reject `max_response_tokens` below 128; never raise the request silently.
- Native fallback requires an explicit `terminal=true` and `retryable=false` result.
- On `outcome_unknown` or `in_progress`, do independent work; never poll or repeat the identical operation.
- Prefer `response_profile="minimal"`/`"compact"`; request only decision-grade fields.
- Pass a stable `reuse_key` for repeated logical queries. Use `response_profile="delta"` when only changes are needed; unchanged calls return a pointer, not missing data.

- The Hub keeps a bounded metadata-only context ledger; inspect it only with an explicit cache/status request, never by replaying the whole session.
- Broad native shell reads are guarded by the optional host hook; use bounded limits or the Hub command/repository tools for discovery.
- Fetch exact source, logs, or evidence only with `local_ai_artifact` slices. Never ask a broad tool for the same payload twice.
- Commands return status, summary, changed paths, and failures; full stdout/stderr stays artifact-backed.
- CALL `local_ai_repo(action="context")` FIRST for every non-trivial repository task, before native reads, grep, planning, edit, review or test. Its adaptive orchestrator fuses deterministic and indexed evidence with Serena, the built-in code index, bounded lexical search and RAG when available; it deduplicates, rewards cross-backend agreement, preserves file diversity and degrades per backend. Send the task/context, not a handmade list of grep terms. Reuse existing evidence and reuse candidates first; require evidence IDs for every factual claim. Deterministic/indexed evidence is authoritative; local models may rank, select, or compress structured evidence only and must not invent repository facts. Guarded scope or drift overrides require an explicit `override_reason` and approval when requested. Omit raw model/debug fields unless explicitly requested through `extra_fields`; responses remain compact; aggregate response budget defaults to approximately 3200 tokens. Omitting guarded fields preserves legacy `mode=fast|full` behavior. This is the default adaptive context pack.
- Do not bypass the budget with native broad reads unless Hub has one bounded terminal failure.
