# TASK: Install, Verify, and Integrate Local AI Hub in Environment & Repository

You are an autonomous AI engineering agent. Your task is to install and configure **Local AI Hub** on this system (if not already installed or running), verify all components (service, Ollama, token economy suite, code intelligence), ensure MCP integration, and inject the canonical tool and token economy policies into this repository's agent instructions.

Execute the following phases deterministically:

---

### PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT PROBE & CLONE

1. **Check Existing Installation**:
   - Standard path:
     - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.local-ai-hub` (or `$HOME\.local-ai-hub`)
     - Linux / macOS: `~/.local-ai-hub`
2. **Clone if Missing**:
   If the directory does not exist or lacks `tools/setup.py`, clone the repository:
   - Git command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Harfusha/local-ai-hub.git "$HOME/.local-ai-hub"
     ```
     *(On Windows PowerShell: `git clone https://github.com/Harfusha/local-ai-hub.git "$HOME\.local-ai-hub"`)*

---

### PHASE 2: RUN BOOTSTRAP INSTALLATION

Run the platform installer from the repository root. This automatically configures Python 3.11+, virtual environment, Token Economy tools, Ollama models, Serena/CodeGraphContext environments, global MCP configs, and background supervisor. The default install deploys the `token-economizer` skill and registers its CLI directory on the user's persistent PATH; verify both after setup, then open a new terminal. Do not pass `--skip-token-economy` or `--skip-companion-skills` for the standard install.

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\install.ps1" -Profile auto
  ```
- **macOS / Linux (Bash)**:
  ```bash
  bash "$HOME/.local-ai-hub/install.sh" --profile auto
  ```

*Note*: If Ollama or specific heavy models cannot be downloaded immediately due to bandwidth or permissions, the installer still sets up deterministic tools and built-in indexers.

---

### PHASE 3: VERIFY SERVICE & HEALTH

1. **Check Service Endpoint**:
   Probe HTTP health (default port 11435):
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11435/health
   ```
   Must return `{"status":"ok", ...}` with the hub version.
2. **If Service Not Running**:
   Start it via python venv:
   - Windows:
     ```powershell
     & "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\tools\service.py" start
     ```
   - Linux / macOS:
     ```bash
     "$HOME/.local-ai-hub/.venv/bin/python" "$HOME/.local-ai-hub/tools/service.py" start
     ```
3. **Run Doctor Diagnostic**:
   - Windows:
     ```powershell
     & "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\tools\doctor.py"
     ```
   - Linux / macOS:
     ```bash
     "$HOME/.local-ai-hub/.venv/bin/python" "$HOME/.local-ai-hub/tools/doctor.py"
     ```
4. **Hardware Acceleration Verification (iGPU / NPU)**:
   - On Intel-only systems, follow `docs/LLAMA_CPP_SYCL.md` and verify that the official SYCL `llama-server.exe --list-devices` lists the Intel GPU before enabling `llama_cpp.mode = "on"`. The installed Hub selects the SYCL backend in `auto` mode when its Intel hardware profile and routes are present. Do not set `OLLAMA_VULKAN` for Intel inference.
   - NVIDIA/AMD discrete GPUs continue through the configured Ollama CUDA/ROCm path. AMD iGPU is not an Intel SYCL target and retains its configured Ollama route. Do not enable llama.cpp SYCL on non-Intel hardware.
   - If an NPU (Intel AI Boost / AMD XDNA) or Intel iGPU is present:
     Ensure OpenVINO dependencies are installed in the venv to offload embeddings and reranking from CPU:
     ```powershell
     & "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\.venv\Scripts\pip.exe" install -r "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\requirements-openvino.txt"
     & "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "$HOME\.local-ai-hub\tools\prefetch_openvino.py"
     ```

---

### PHASE 4: INJECT INSTRUCTIONS INTO CURRENT REPOSITORY

Inspect current repository root for existing agent instruction files:
- Universal: `AGENTS.md`
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md`
- Cursor: `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/local-ai.mdc`
- Windsurf: `.windsurfrules`
- Gemini: `GEMINI.md`
- Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Action**:
1. If no instruction file exists, create `AGENTS.md` at repository root.
2. In `AGENTS.md` (and any other active instruction files detected above), ensure the following two exact policy blocks are present. If older versions exist, update them between the markers; otherwise append them:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN LOCAL AI HUB TOOL POLICY -->
Trigger map:
- repository facts/files/symbols: `local_ai_repo`
- tests/lint/typecheck/build: `local_ai_command`
- exact source/evidence text: `local_ai_artifact`
- shared findings or overlapping edits: `local_ai_coord`
- semantic retrieval after indexed paths are insufficient: `local_ai_rag`
- bounded local generation or second opinion: `local_ai_task`
- closed whole-task delegation with verified handoff: `local_ai_work`

Recipes (guidance, not gates):
- Recipe — Explore: preprocess once, use the cheapest repository action, fetch only required evidence slices.
- Recipe — Change: gather indexed evidence, use `local_ai_repo(action="solve")` before edits, claim `local_ai_coord` leases for overlapping paths, then run indexed impact/review before validation.
- Recipe — Validate: route repeatable commands through `local_ai_command`, reuse cached results, use `review_diff` or `security_audit` when relevant.
- Recipe — Retrieve: use `local_ai_rag` only after deterministic/indexed paths are exhausted.
- A recipe step may be skipped when irrelevant; one bounded fallback is allowed when Hub is unavailable.

Delegation is the default for any task with useful bounded independent work.

- Use `local_ai_task` for bounded local-model work when local inference is the right fit. Use `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` only for quick/simple tasks, `qwen2.5-coder:3b` for ordinary and more involved work, `qwen2.5-coder:7b` for the hardest reasoning, and `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b` only for preprocessing.
- Use the native Codex `multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` path only for useful independent bounded work or an explicit Codex-subagent request.
- Codex controls each subagent's scope, `allow_write`, workspace/worktree, timeout, cancellation, sandbox, and integration.
- Do not duplicate the same scope across agents. Keep final decisions, edits, and integration in Codex.
- Skip delegation only for trivial tasks, pure evidence lookups, security/privacy constraints, or no useful independent scope.

Routing hierarchy: the main agent is the orchestrator, planner, integrator and final owner. Use Local AI Hub first for its own precise, bounded microtasks: deterministic facts, indexed/search retrieval, preprocess artifacts, targeted impact/review/security checks, safe commands, compression, local-model synthesis and second opinions. Native `multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` is used only for useful independent bounded work or an explicit Codex-subagent request. It is not routed or managed by Local AI Hub.

READ-ONLY AUDIT CONTRACT:
- Read-only means no Git writes, `git worktree add` or removal, dependency installation, builds/imports, generated artifacts, or other workspace side effects. Never label such work read-only when any of these occur; split validation into a separately owned, explicitly side-effecting task.
- Before native discovery or validation, retain preceding Hub result with action, absolute root, status, cache/in_progress state, and evidence IDs. Native discovery is fallback-only after one bounded terminal Hub failure.
- Native validation fallback is allowed only after `local_ai_command` returns `terminal=true` and `retryable=false`; run one bounded fallback, state side effects/owner, and never repeat identical commands.
- Codex controls subagent permissions per task. Native Codex subagents may write only when Codex explicitly enables it, and write work stays in the assigned workspace/worktree. Codex remains integrator.
- Do not run parallel duplicate commands or scopes. Tool labels are not evidence; preserve exact action, arguments, result, and ownership in the audit record.

For every non-trivial repository task, use Local AI Hub before broad native discovery or repeatable validation. Keep one stable absolute project root. On the first task for that root call `local_ai_repo(action="preprocess", root=ABS_ROOT)` exactly once, then continue immediately; preprocessing is asynchronous, so never poll/wait/force-refresh it.

Adoption gate: `local_ai_command` alone is never sufficient for a repository task. The first useful Hub operation must be `local_ai_repo` (preprocess plus the cheapest applicable deterministic/code-index/search/context action); use the command broker only for commands, after repository evidence exists. For implementation, diagnosis, refactoring or complex review, call `local_ai_repo(action="solve")` after evidence and before native edits. After edits, use the applicable indexed impact/review/security/evidence action before final validation.

Cheapest path: deterministic -> code_index/search -> semantic/graph -> context/solve -> RAG -> qwen2.5-coder:1.5b quick/simple generation -> qwen2.5-coder:3b ordinary and more involved work -> qwen2.5-coder:7b hardest reasoning.
 Stop escalating as soon as a cheaper layer provides enough evidence. Do not fan out overlapping retrieval layers in parallel for the same question. Before native `find`/`rg`/`grep`/recursive glob/tree or opening more than two files for discovery, use that hub path first. Reuse fresh evidence IDs, artifact slices, memos and cache hits;
 do not repeat the same hub action with the same root/query while repository state is unchanged.

Treat result state as a protocol: `cache_hit`/`coalesced` means reuse the result; `in_progress=true` means another owner is doing identical work, so never duplicate it; `retryable`/429/503 means back off and do independent work; `degraded`/`stale` means verify only the affected path/slice; a non-retryable failure permits one cheaper/native fallback. Never turn a transient result into larger timeouts, force refreshes, or polling loops.

Route test/lint/typecheck/build/read-only commands through `local_ai_command` before running them natively. If it returns `in_progress=true`, do not launch a duplicate command. Before an expensive `solve`/model call, search coordination memos for reusable findings. For overlapping multi-agent edits use `local_ai_coord` leases and store concise reusable discoveries as memos.
 After edits, use indexed impact/review plus targeted cached validation; do not rerun broad discovery merely because files changed. `force` and `preprocess_refresh` are recovery/admin controls, never retry buttons. If an optional backend degrades, accept the hub's deterministic/index fallback. If the hub itself is unavailable, make one bounded health/retry attempt, then fall back to native tools. Never loop on health, status, preprocessing, model startup, a failing backend, or an identical command.

Selection guide: `local_ai_repo` for bounded repository facts and checks (including `review_diff` and `security_audit`), `local_ai_command` for bounded repeatable commands, `local_ai_task` for small local-model work and second opinions, `local_ai_work` for a complete bounded repository task with planning, edits, validation and handoff, `local_ai_rag` only after cheaper indexed evidence, `local_ai_artifact` for exact slices, `local_ai_coord` for leases/memos.

Local model policy: use `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b` only for preprocessing, `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` only for quick/simple requests, `qwen2.5-coder:3b` for ordinary and more involved work, and `qwen2.5-coder:7b` for the hardest reasoning. Deterministic and indexed Hub actions run first.
<!-- END LOCAL AI HUB TOOL POLICY -->

<!-- BEGIN TOKEN ECONOMY POLICY -->
- Before any repository task, load and follow the `token-economizer` skill when it is installed; this trigger applies even under deadline pressure.
- Zero full-file dumping: Never read files >80 lines in their entirety. Use `repo-map` for high-level structure, `grep-ast <pattern> <file>`, targeted line slices, or `local_ai_artifact(action="slice")`.
- Fast code search: Use `rg` (`ripgrep`) with `-m 5` / bounded matches and `fd` for file finding before opening files.
- AST & structural code search: Use `ast-grep` (`sg`), Serena LSP (`find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`), or `local_ai_repo(action="code_index")` before opening files.
- Context compression & token measurement: Use `repomix --compress` or `files-to-prompt -c` for repo snapshots. Use `tokcount` to measure exact tokens.
- Bounded command outputs: Route tests and builds through `local_ai_command`; use `trim-run` only with bundled `tokcount`/`repo-map`, read-only `rg`/`fd`/`grep-ast`, or stdin pipelines such as `git log | trim-run`. Use `jq` for JSON.
- Surgical edits: Prefer targeted block replacements over rewriting entire files.
- Local model delegation: Use `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` only for quick/simple microtasks, `qwen2.5-coder:3b` for ordinary and more involved work, and `qwen2.5-coder:7b` for the hardest reasoning via `local_ai_task`; reserve `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b` for preprocessing.
<!-- END TOKEN ECONOMY POLICY -->

### PHASE 5: REPOSITORY / WORKSPACE MCP REGISTRATION (IF APPLICABLE)

If this workspace uses repository-scoped MCP (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json`), ensure the `local-ai` server entry is defined:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-ai": {
      "command": "<HOME>/.local-ai-hub/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "local_ai_hub.mcp_server"],
      "cwd": "<HOME>/.local-ai-hub",
      "env": {
        "LOCAL_AI_AGENT": "generic",
        "LOCAL_AI_AGENT_PROFILE": "generic",
        "LOCAL_AI_CONFIG": "<HOME>/.local-ai-hub/config.toml",
        "PYTHONPATH": "<HOME>/.local-ai-hub/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
*(On Windows, replace paths with Windows equivalents: `...\\Scripts\\python.exe`, backslashes, etc.)*

---

### PHASE 6: INITIAL REPO INDEXING & HANDSHAKE

Trigger one-time asynchronous preprocessing on the current repository root:
- If `local_ai_repo` MCP tool is available in your active session:
  Execute `local_ai_repo(action="preprocess", root="<ABSOLUTE_CURRENT_REPO_PATH>")`.
- Or trigger via HTTP loopback:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:11435/api/repo/preprocess \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"root\": \"$(pwd)\"}"
  ```

---

### PHASE 7: STATUS REPORT

Output concise confirmation with:
1. Local AI Hub version and service status (`online` / `offline`).
2. Tools verified (`rg`, `fd`, `ast-grep`, `repomix`, `tokcount`, `trim-run`).
3. Ollama & models status.
4. Instruction files created/modified in this repo.
5. Readiness confirmation.
```
